# AStarPathfinding
Basic A* Pathfinding in Unity (old)  
This is an old program that used an A* pathfinding algorithm in Unity. The majority of the project was completed using tutorials from CodeMonkey on YouTube. This concept was originally intended to be used in a Tower Defense style game, however that project was never persued. The code written here is very similar to the code that was completed in the CodeMonkey tutorial, as the purpose of this project was to learn about the A* algorithm so that I can implement into later projects.  
  
## What Is A* Pathfinding?  
The A* algorithm works by checking to find the "cost" of moving to the tiles on the grid. It then takes the cheapest route to get from the start to the end.

## Notes
* Due to this project being outdated some functions tend to be a bit buggy.  
* This project was intended to also visualize how to A* algorithm works, however upon updating the project to the latest version of Unity that feature did not work, thus it was removed.  
* The original video that was referenced: https://youtu.be/alU04hvz6L4  
  * Please note that this was not the only video referenced when completing this project, but it was the main source of knowledge and code. Other debugging and research was done       seperately
